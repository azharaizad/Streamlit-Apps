                 This project leverages the SEMMA methodology to help users select the best laptops based on their preferences."
                 The SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess) methodology offers a structured approach to solving data 
                 analytics problems, enabling the effective application of machine learning techniques. This project applies 
                 SEMMA to predict laptop prices using two advanced machine learning algorithms, Random Gradient Boosting 
                 Regressor (RGBRegressor) and LightGBM (LGBM), and evaluates the accuracy of predictions compared to actual 
                 prices. Accurate price predictions are crucial for e-commerce platforms and consumers alike, helping to 
                 optimize pricing strategies and ensure competitive market positioning.

                 \nThe project begins by sampling a publicly available dataset containing laptop specifications and 
                 corresponding prices to create a manageable and representative dataset. The exploration phase 
                 involves analyzing key features, such as processor type, RAM, storage capacity, and brand, to 
                 understand their relationship with pricing. In the modification phase, the data undergoes 
                 preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling 
                 numerical features. Using this cleaned dataset, RGBRegressor and LGBM models are trained to 
                 predict laptop prices. Finally, the models are assessed based on their accuracy and performance 
                 metrics, such as RMSE and RÂ², with a comparative analysis highlighting their effectiveness in 
                 predicting prices. This process not only demonstrates the practical application of SEMMA but also 
                 provides valuable insights for businesses and consumers in the tech market.
